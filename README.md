#DRF

Django Rest Framework (or simply DRF) is a powerful module for building web APIs.
It's very easy to build model-backed APIs that have authentication policies and are browsable.

# Why DRF
Authentication – From basic and session-based authentication to token-based and Oauth2 capabilities .
Serialization – It supports both ORM and Non-ORM data sources and seemlessly integrates with your database.
Great Documentation – If you get stuck somewhere, you can refer to it's vast online documentation and great community support
Companies - Heroku, Mozilla, Red Hat, and Eventbrite are among the top companies using DRF in their APIs.
